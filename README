Modular C# irc bot
Script Fiend runs in a terminal, can connect to multiple IRC servers and rooms, and can handle multiple requests at a time.
Modules can be built in the source code at the moment. 
To create new modules extend Module.cs and add the module to a IRC Line such as ChannelLine.cs.
Eventually, the bot will be able to dynamically load dll files for modules. However this functionality is not present at this time.

ScriptFiend requires Microsoft.Json and System.Data.SQLite to function.
