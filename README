Modular C# irc bot
Script Fiend runs in a terminal, connects to multiple IRC servers and rooms, and handles multiple requests at a time.
Modules must be built in the source code at the moment. 
To create new modules extend Module.cs and add the module to an IRC Line such as ChannelLine.cs.
Eventually, the bot will be able to dynamically load dll files for modules. However this functionality is not present at this time.

ScriptFiend requires Microsoft.Json and System.Data.SQLite to function.
